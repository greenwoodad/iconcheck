has failed to run due to a failure of the deuterium lock. This may reflect an issue with your sample (small volume, off centered, particulate/insolubility, a mixture of deuterated solvents), the setup (incorrect solvent being selected), or the spectrometer itself. Please check your sample and resubmit at your convenience. If you believe your sample is prepared appropriately, please speak with the NMR lab manager.
