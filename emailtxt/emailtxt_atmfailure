has failed to run due to a failure of the tuning and matching. This can result if a sample has very high ionic strength, or if the instrument is not configured for the submitted experiment. If you suspect your sample is too salty, you can dilute it and resubmit at your convenience. If you believe your sample is prepared appropriately and that the selected experiment is not incompatible with the current instrument configuration, please speak with the NMR lab manager.
